## 1. Boston Public Schools in decline

Boston has seen steady enrollment decline over the past decade, losing over 10,000 students.

```{r boston-decline}
boston <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id == "0035",
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

ggplot(boston, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, color = colors["total"]) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = colors["total"]) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, limits = c(0, NA)) +
  labs(title = "Boston Public Schools Enrollment",
       subtitle = "Steady decline over the past decade",
       x = "School Year", y = "Students") +
  theme_readme()
```

## 2. Gateway Cities holding steady

Springfield, Worcester, and Lowell - Massachusetts' "Gateway Cities" - have maintained relatively stable enrollment.

```{r gateway-cities}
gateway <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id %in% c("0281", "0365", "0145"),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

ggplot(gateway, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = district_name)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Gateway Cities Enrollment",
       subtitle = "Springfield, Worcester, and Lowell",
       x = "School Year", y = "Students", color = "") +

## 3. Massachusetts demographics shift

The state has seen a significant shift in racial/ethnic composition over the past decade.

```{r demographics-shift}
demo <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian"))

ggplot(demo, aes(x = end_year, y = pct * 100, color = subgroup)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +

## 4. Cape and Islands enrollment declining

Cape Cod and the Islands have seen declining enrollment as seasonal communities age.

cape <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Barnstable|Nauset|Monomoy|Martha|Nantucket", district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

## 5. COVID hit kindergarten hardest

The pandemic caused a sharp drop in kindergarten enrollment in 2020-21 that has persisted.

```{r covid-kindergarten}
k_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "06", "12")) %>%
  mutate(grade_label = case_when(
    grade_level == "K" ~ "Kindergarten",
    grade_level == "01" ~ "Grade 1",
    grade_level == "06" ~ "Grade 6",
    grade_level == "12" ~ "Grade 12"
  ))

ggplot(k_trend, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = grade_label)) +

## 7. Economic disadvantage trends

The percentage of students classified as economically disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years.

```{r econ-disadvantage}
econ <- enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "econ_disadv", grade_level == "TOTAL")

el <- enr_current %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "lep", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  mutate(district_label = reorder(district_name, n_students))

ggplot(el, aes(x = district_label, y = n_students)) +
  geom_col(fill = colors["total"]) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +

## 10. Regional districts serve rural Massachusetts

Regional school districts consolidate resources across rural communities.

```{r regional-districts}
regional <- enr_current %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Regional", district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  mutate(district_label = reorder(district_name, n_students))

ggplot(regional, aes(x = district_label, y = n_students)) +
  geom_col(fill = colors["total"]) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Regional School Districts",
       subtitle = "Top 10 regional districts by enrollment",
       x = "", y = "Students") +

```

## 11. Springfield's demographic transformation

Springfield, the state's third-largest district, has experienced a dramatic demographic shift over the past decade, with Hispanic students now comprising the majority.

```{r springfield-demographics}
springfield_demo <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id == "0281", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian"))

       x = "School Year", y = "Percent", color = "") +
  theme_readme()
```

## 12. Fall River and New Bedford: SouthCoast struggles

The two largest SouthCoast cities share similar trajectories - former mill towns with persistent economic challenges and declining enrollment.

```{r southcoast-cities}
southcoast <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id %in% c("0079", "0192"),  # Fall River, New Bedford
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

ggplot(southcoast, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = district_name)) +

## 13. Worcester suburbs are growing

While Worcester itself has held steady, its suburban ring - Shrewsbury, Westborough, and Grafton - shows consistent growth.

```{r worcester-suburbs}
worcester_suburbs <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district, district_id %in% c("0270", "0330", "0097"),  # Shrewsbury, Westborough, Grafton
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

ggplot(worcester_suburbs, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = district_name)) +

```

## 14. Western MA faces population decline

The Pioneer Valley and Berkshire counties have seen persistent enrollment declines as young families move east or out of state.

```{r western-ma-decline}
# Major Western MA districts
western_ma <- enr %>%
  filter(is_district,
         district_id %in% c("0199", "0003", "0211", "0098"),  # Northampton, Amherst, Pittsfield, Great Barrington
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(western_ma, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, color = colors["total"]) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = colors["total"]) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Western Massachusetts Enrollment",

## 15. Special education shows gender imbalance

Across Massachusetts, boys are identified for special education services at nearly twice the rate of girls.

```{r sped-gender}
sped_gender <- enr_current %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("sped", "male", "female")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)

# Get gender breakdown within SPED at district level
sped_by_district <- enr_current %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "sped", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  mutate(district_label = reorder(district_name, pct))

ggplot(sped_by_district, aes(x = district_label, y = pct * 100)) +
  geom_col(fill = colors["total"]) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Special Education Rates by District",
       subtitle = "Top 15 districts by percent of students receiving SPED services",
       x = "", y = "Percent SPED") +
