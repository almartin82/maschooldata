\title{Fetch Massachusetts graduation rate data}
\usage{
fetch_graduation(end_year, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year. Year is the end of the academic year - eg 2023-24
school year is year '2024'. Valid values are 2006-2024.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in long (tidy) format with
subgroup column. If FALSE, returns wide format.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from DESE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with graduation rate data. Wide format includes columns for
district_id, school_id, names, subgroup, cohort_type, cohort_count,
graduate_count, and grad_rate. Tidy format is the same (API data is already
in long format).
}
\description{
Downloads and processes graduation rate data from the Massachusetts Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) via their Socrata API
(educationtocareer.data.mass.gov).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get 2024 graduation data (2023-24 school year)
grad_2024 <- fetch_graduation(2024)

# Get historical data from 2010
grad_2010 <- fetch_graduation(2010)

# Get wide format (already wide from API)
grad_wide <- fetch_graduation(2024, tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
grad_fresh <- fetch_graduation(2024, use_cache = FALSE)

# Filter to Boston Public Schools
boston <- grad_2024 |>
  dplyr::filter(district_id == "0035")

# Compare 4-year and 5-year rates
rates <- grad_2024 |>
  dplyr::filter(is_state, subgroup == "all") |>
  dplyr::select(cohort_type, grad_rate, cohort_count)
}
